**Have you decided to move to Salesforce but not sure of where to start?** 

It all starts with an understanding of how the implementation process works, who needs to be involved and what to focus on.

With this information you can create a plan tailored to your business and goals.

Let’s get started.


## Define Your Business Objectives and Goals
Why did you decide to move to Salesforce?  Maybe you want to increase your win rate, better understand your customers, automate your marketing processes or increase collaboration between your sales and marketing teams.

These are your business objectives and how you will evaluate the success of your project. It is important for you to make sure they are not only understood but agreed upon by your team. As you go through the implementation process you will need to constantly check back to make sure that the things you are doing map back to your business objectives.

If your goals are measurable then this is the time to analyze your current situation to establish your baseline. Then when you are looking back in a few months from now you can measure your current state against that baseline to see how well you did.

## Form Your Implementation Team
Now it’s time to figure out who will be involved in your move to Salesforce, what they will do and how they will work together. Since this is the first time you are using Salesforce I assume you will be using an implementation partner.

The common roles in an implementation project are:

Executive Sponsor
The executive sponsor is accountable for the overall success of the project. While they may not be heavily involved in the day to day tasks, they will be responsible for ensuring the project stays on track and helps resolve any conflicts or obstacles that come up.

Project Manager
The project manager is responsible for the day to day activities of the team, ensuring that the expected results are delivered within the agreed upon time and budget. They will develop the project plan, allocate work, coordinate with partners and track progress

Department Owner
This would be your marketing manager, sales director, CMO or customer support manager. They are responsible to verify that the desired outcomes for their department are met and for driving user adoption. 

Business Users
Business users provide expert input on how things work and how they should work in the future. They play a key role when gathering requirements and will be involved in other parts of the process like user acceptance testing.

Business Analyst
Business analysts help define the requirements of the system and the overall design. They will work with the business users to understand existing business processes and how they can be improved.

Sales Administrators, Solution Architects and Developers
Your implementation partner will generally fill these roles. They have the deep Salesforce knowledge required to make customization and configuration changes that map to your requirements defined by your team. 

Depending on the size of your company, one person can fill more than one role. Some of these roles can be filled by your implementation partner.

## Start Small
When I first started helping companies implement business applications it was not uncommon for a company to spend years on it’s first go live. As you can imagine, waiting that long to get any value out of a system that cost millions of dollars was painful. Not only that but by the time it was completed the business could have completely shifted its focus. A lot of times the changes were happening, the requirements were being modified as they went along which stretched timelines much further out. 

Luckily, things have improved. Software is more adaptable than ever and easier to configure. 

Companies expect to see results within a few weeks or months. In my experience it is best to start with one department in your company and expand out over time. A lot of times it starts with the Sales or Marketing team. As you prove that Salesforce delivers more value than the cost, you can bring on other teams.

## Data Migration Considerations
There are many ways to move data from your old system or spreadsheets into Salesforce. If you only have a few thousand contacts, leads and accounts, then the Import Wizard will be all you need. If you have more than that then you may need to use more advanced tools like the Data Loader, dataloader.io and Cloudingo. Your Salesforce partner will be able to do all of the migration work for you. They may even have their own specialized tool to make things easier. 

**Tip:**
One of the steps in data migration is data cleanup. This includes removing duplicates, filling in empty fields like the state field and invalid phone number formats. You can save a lot of money by doing this work yourself in your current system.


## Salesforce Customization and Configuration 
In order to get Salesforce to work the way you work you have to make configurations and customizations. This includes process flows, page layouts, adding users, user permissions, creating reports and dashboards and more. 

**Tip:**
Many Salesforce implementation partners are focused on the technology and not on business processes, even though they may say they aren’t. You can reduce the risk of going over budget by documenting your business processes ahead of time. In addition, you probably have adapted the way you work based on your old systems. Now is a good time to revisit how you do things and optimize your process without thinking about the technology.

## The Implementation Process
The project process defines how you will work both internally and with your implementation partner. The most common process that we follow is Agile. Essentially, the goal of Agile is to deliver value as quickly as possible while reducing risk. The theory is that most of the time you will not be able to deliver exactly what was expected on the first try. So it’s better to deliver more often, getting closer to the desired outcome with each iteration. These shorter iterations are called “sprints” and can last from one week to several weeks.

Steps in the project process  ( 1 sprint ):
1. Understand business problems, goals and processes
2. Propose solutions
3. Document solutions along with testing scenarios
4. Customize and configure Salesforce
5. Stakeholders review what has been done
6. User acceptance testing
7. Train users
8. Go live
9. Debrief 
10. Repeat until you have accomplished all of your goals
